### I'm going to have to extract the upper triangler only first ###
"""
Steps: 
1. Extract FC/SC baseline matrices
  1a. Extract FC matrices for all subjects (both <18 and >=18)
  1b. Extract SC matrices for all subjects (from "tractography_subcortical" folder)
2. Load the FC and SC matrices and the target labels (y)
  2a. The y is group1 and group2 so I have to first identify individuals in group1 and group2 and then assign them 0 and 1
3. Extract them into upper triangular matrices
4. Look at the code below and see which to use/modify/take out.
